Hi there, 

I have worked on mainly below points. 

1. Segreation of code in layers clean architecture.
2. Depedency injection using autofact.
3. Async programming.
4. Common Api Response.
5. Code commenting and defined regions. 
6. Worked only on below API endpoints

1. `GET /products` - gets all products.
2. `GET /products?name={name}` - finds all products matching the specified name.
3. `GET /products/{id}` - gets the project that matches the specified ID - ID is a GUID.
4. `POST /products` - creates a new product.
